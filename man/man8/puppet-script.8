puppet script [\-h|\-\-help] [\-V|\-\-version] [\-d|\-\-debug] [\-v|\-\-verbose] [\-e|\-\-execute] [\-l|\-\-logdest syslog|eventlog|\fIFILE\fR|console] [\-\-noop] \fIfile\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is a standalone puppet script runner tool; use it to run puppet code without compiling a catalog\.
.P
When provided with a modulepath, via command line or config file, puppet script can load functions, types, tasks and plans from modules\.
.SH "OPTIONS"
Note that any setting that's valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument\. For example, 'environment' is a valid setting, so you can specify '\-\-environment mytest' as an argument\.
.P
See the configuration file documentation at https://puppet\.com/docs/puppet/latest/configuration\.html for the full list of acceptable parameters\. A commented list of all configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with '\-\-genconfig'\.
.TP
\-\-debug
Enable full debugging\.
.TP
\-\-help
Print this help message
.TP
\-\-logdest
Where to send log messages\. Choose between 'syslog' (the POSIX syslog service), 'eventlog' (the Windows Event Log), 'console', or the path to a log file\. Defaults to 'console'\. Multiple destinations can be set using a comma separated list (eg: \fB/path/file1,console,/path/file2\fR)"
.IP
A path ending with '\.json' will receive structured output in JSON format\. The log file will not have an ending ']' automatically written to it due to the appending nature of logging\. It must be appended manually to make the content valid JSON\.
.IP
A path ending with '\.jsonl' will receive structured output in JSON Lines format\.
.TP
\-\-noop
Use 'noop' mode where Puppet runs in a no\-op or dry\-run mode\. This is useful for seeing what changes Puppet will make without actually executing the changes\. Applies to tasks only\.
.TP
\-\-execute
Execute a specific piece of Puppet code
.TP
\-\-verbose
Print extra information\.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.nf
$ puppet script \-l /tmp/manifest\.log manifest\.pp
$ puppet script \-\-modulepath=/root/dev/modules \-e 'notice("hello world")'
