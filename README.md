# OpenVox

OpenVox is a community implementation of Puppet, an automated administrative engine for your Linux, Unix, and Windows systems, designed to perform
administrative tasks (such as adding users, installing packages, and updating server
configurations) based on a centralized specification.

## Documentation

As of now, OpenVox is effectively the same as the original Puppet™️ packages, aside from some minor build pipeline changes and package renaming.
This means that aside from the installation, all Puppet™️ docs and tutorials will still be completely applicable.
As the OpenVox project matures, we will create more documentation, guides, and tutorials.
For the time being though, now you’ll want to hop over to [Puppet’s own documentation](https://puppet.com/docs) and go from there.

We use semantic version numbers for our releases and recommend that users stay
as up-to-date as possible by upgrading to patch releases and minor releases as
they become available.

Bug fixes and ongoing development will occur in minor releases for the current
major version. Security fixes will be backported to a previous major version on
a best-effort basis, until the previous major version is no longer maintained.

For example: If a security vulnerability is discovered in Puppet 8.1.1, we
would fix it in the 8 series, most likely as 8.1.2. Maintainers would then make
a best effort to backport that fix onto earlier releases that haven't reached
their respective end-of-life dates.
