OpenVox can generate a report after applying a catalog. This report includes
events, log messages, resource statuses, and metrics and metadata about the run.
OpenVox agent sends its report to a OpenVox server, and OpenVox apply
processes its own reports.

The OpenVox server and OpenVox apply will handle every report with a set of report
processors, configurable with the `reports` setting in puppet.conf. This page
documents the built-in report processors.

See [About Reporting](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/reporting_about.html)
for more details.
